image_classification

This directory contains the image classification model used to determine type
of trash

To run:
Download tensor flow 2.4.1 using '$pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow' inside of a virtual environment (venv).
Download any of the missing imports from model.py using the same pip install inside of the same virtual environment.
Then edit the directory path to fit your machine for the compost net data set and the image test at the end.
Once all of the libraries are install you can run '$python3 model.py'.
